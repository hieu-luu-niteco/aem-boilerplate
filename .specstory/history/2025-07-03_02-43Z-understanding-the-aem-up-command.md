I see that this project can be started by  running command:   aem up
please explain how this work

I'll help you understand how the `aem up` command works in this project. Let me start by exploring the project structure to find the relevant configuration files.

Let me check the `package.json` file to see if there are any scripts defined, particularly the `aem up` command:


---

Read file: package.json

---

I don't see the `aem up` command in the package.json scripts. Let me check if there's a global AEM CLI tool or if there are any configuration files that might define this command. Let me also check the README to understand more about the project:


---

Read file: README.md

---

Perfect! Now I can see how the `aem up` command works. Let me also check if there's an `fstab.yaml` file to understand the mountpoint configuration:


---

Read file: fstab.yaml

---

Now let me search for any additional configuration files that might be related to the AEM CLI:

Let me check the `scripts/aem.js` file as it might contain custom AEM-related functionality:

Read file: scripts/aem.js

This file appears to be a utility script for the AEM project, not the CLI command itself. Let me check if there are any other configuration files or if the AEM CLI is installed globally. Let me also search for any documentation about the AEM CLI:

Based on my exploration of the project, I can now explain how the `aem up` command works in this AEM boilerplate project:

## How `aem up` Works

The `aem up` command is part of the **AEM CLI** (Adobe Experience Manager Command Line Interface), which is a global Node.js package that needs to be installed separately. Here's how it works:

### 1. **Prerequisites**
Before you can use `aem up`, you need to:
- Install the AEM CLI globally: `npm install -g @adobe/aem-cli`
- Have the project properly configured with a mountpoint in `fstab.yaml`

### 2. **Project Configuration**
The project uses several key configuration files:

- **`fstab.yaml`**: Defines the mountpoint that maps the root path (`/`) to a Google Drive folder containing the content
- **`package.json`**: Contains project metadata and linting scripts
- **`scripts/aem.js`**: Contains utility functions for the AEM project (not the CLI itself)

### 3. **What `aem up` Does**
When you run `aem up`, the AEM CLI:

1. **Starts a local development server** on `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Sets up a proxy** that serves your local project files
3. **Connects to the content source** (in this case, the Google Drive folder specified in `fstab.yaml`)
4. **Opens your browser** automatically to the local development URL
5. **Enables live reloading** so changes to your code are reflected immediately

### 4. **Project Structure**
The AEM boilerplate follows a specific structure:
- **`blocks/`**: Contains reusable content blocks
- **`styles/`**: CSS files for styling
- **`scripts/`**: JavaScript utilities and functionality
- **`fstab.yaml`**: Content mountpoint configuration
- **`head.html`**: HTML head template

### 5. **Development Workflow**
The typical development workflow is:
1. Run `aem up` to start the local server
2. Make changes to your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files
3. See changes reflected immediately in the browser
4. Use the AEM Code Sync GitHub App to deploy changes

The `aem up` command essentially creates a local development environment that mimics the AEM Live platform, allowing you to develop and test your AEM project locally before deploying it to the live environment.
